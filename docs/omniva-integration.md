# Omniva Integration Implementation Notes

## What Worked

The Omniva integration was successfully implemented with the following key components:

1. **Simple PHP Endpoint**
   - Created a dedicated PHP endpoint at `public/php/omniva_integration/get_locations.php`
   - Used native `file_get_contents()` to fetch data from Omniva's API
   - Implemented proper error handling with try/catch blocks
   - Returned clean, filtered JSON data

2. **Proper Routing**
   - Updated `public/php/index.php` to route requests to the correct handler
   - Used query string parameters (`?path=`) instead of PATH_INFO
   - Implemented proper content type headers

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Added caching mechanism to reduce API calls
   - Implemented loading states for better UX
   - Added error handling for failed API requests
   - Filtered and sorted locations for better usability

4. **Server Configuration**
   - Fixed `.htaccess` file to properly route API requests
   - Removed PHP configuration directives that might not be supported
   - Used simpler, more compatible rewrite rules

## Common Pitfalls Avoided

1. **Diff Syntax Issues**
   - Ensured files contained actual code, not diff syntax
   - This prevented the "Unexpected token '@', "@@ .. @@" error

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Used native PHP functions instead of external libraries
   - Avoided complex SDK dependencies that might not be available

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added proper error reporting and handling
   - Returned meaningful error messages to the frontend

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implemented client-side caching to reduce API calls
   - Filtered data on the server to reduce payload size

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Modular Design**
   - Kept the Omniva integration in its own directory
   - Created a dedicated endpoint for parcel machine locations

2. **Error Handling**
   - Used try/catch blocks to handle exceptions
   - Returned proper HTTP status codes
   - Included meaningful error messages

3. **Security**
   - Validated and sanitized input parameters
   - Used proper content type headers

4. **User Experience**
   - Added loading states
   - Implemented error messages
   - Sorted locations alphabetically for easier selection

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check file contents after applying changes to ensure they contain actual code, not diff syntax.
2. Use simple, standard PHP functions when possible to avoid compatibility issues.
3. Implement proper error handling on both frontend and backend.
4. Test API endpoints independently before integrating with the frontend.
5. Use client-side caching for data that doesn't change frequently.
