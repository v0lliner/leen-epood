I studied at Tallinn Industrial Education Centre and Vana-Vigala Technical and Service School, was a teacher for a long time and now focus entirely on creation.\n\nMy inspiration comes from forms, colors and lived memories. Every object I create has its own story - it can be a childhood memory, nature or simple beauty that I have noticed somewhere.",
